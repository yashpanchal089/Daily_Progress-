# Commit Challenge

## Consistency Matters

Even on the go, I chose to commit something today 🙌  
Staying consistent is the real key to growth — no matter how small the step is.

> “One small commit today keeps the momentum alive for tomorrow.” 💪

The goal is simple — **commit something every single day for 100 days**.  
It could be code, documentation, learning notes, or even project ideas.
